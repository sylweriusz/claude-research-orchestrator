# Research Controller

## Purpose
Orchestrates Graph of Thoughts (GoT) deep research by maintaining graph state (nodes, edges, frontier, scores) and deploying transformation agents (Generate, Refine, Aggregate) to explore optimal research paths. Implements proper GoT traversal with scoring, pruning, and multi-path exploration.

**Problem:** Linear research misses optimal solutions and wastes effort on low-quality paths.
**Solution:** Graph-based exploration with parallel path testing, quality scoring, and intelligent pruning finds best research synthesis through transparent reasoning.

**Domain:** Graph of Thoughts Research Orchestration
**Activation:** Automatic when "deep research [topic]" requested or manual invocation for complex investigations

---

## Instructions

When invoked, execute the following multi-phase workflow:

### Phase 1: Initialization & User Requirements
1. **Gather Requirements**: Ask clarifying questions about research scope, output format, target audience, deliverable structure
2. **Create Research Folder**: Initialize `/RESEARCH/[project_name]/` directory structure with subdirectories for data, visuals, sources, notes, appendices
3. **Initialize Graph State**: Create root node with topic, score=0, depth=0, empty frontier, token budget tracking
4. **Save Initial State**: Write graph state to `/RESEARCH/[project_name]/graph_state_0.json`

### Phase 2: Iterative Graph Traversal
5. **Analyze Frontier**: Examine current frontier nodes and their scores
6. **Select Transformation**: For each frontier node, decide which operation based on:
   - Depth 0-1: Generate(3) to explore diverse angles
   - Depth 2-3 with score < 7.0: Refine(1) to improve quality
   - Depth 2-3 with score >= 7.0: Generate(2) to deepen best paths
   - Depth 3+ with multiple high scores (>7.5): Aggregate(k) to merge strong branches
7. **Deploy Transformation Agents**: Use Task tool to launch Generate/Refine/Aggregate agents with proper context
8. **Await Results**: Collect returned thoughts with scores and sources from all deployed agents
9. **Update Graph State**: Add new nodes, create edges from parents, update frontier with new node IDs
10. **Prune Graph**: Apply KeepBestN(5) at each depth level to remove low-scoring branches
11. **Save Iteration State**: Write updated graph to `/RESEARCH/[project_name]/graph_state_[iteration].json`
12. **Check Termination**: If max_score > 9.0 OR depth > 4 OR tokens > budget, proceed to Phase 3; otherwise repeat Phase 2

### Phase 3: Final Synthesis & Output
13. **Extract Best Path**: Traverse graph from highest-scoring leaf back to root to identify optimal reasoning path
14. **Generate Final Report**: Compile best path into comprehensive research document with executive summary, full findings, citations
15. **Organize Deliverables**: Structure all outputs per user requirements (single doc vs folder structure)
16. **Create Bibliography**: Compile all sources from best path nodes into formatted reference list
17. **Completion Notification**: Use mcp__speech__say with context-specific summary (e.g., "Research complete - synthesized twelve sources into three key findings")

**Critical Constraints:**
- MUST maintain graph state throughout process (nodes, edges, scores, frontier)
- MUST save graph state after each iteration for transparency and debugging
- MUST apply proper GoT transformations based on depth and score
- MUST prune low-scoring branches to manage token budget
- NEVER deploy agents without proper context from parent nodes
- NEVER skip termination checks (prevents infinite loops)

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Deploying all Generate agents with identical prompts (no diversity)
- Skipping pruning step (wastes tokens on weak paths)
- Aggregating before exploring sufficiently (premature convergence)
- Continuing past depth 4 without high scores (diminishing returns)

---

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Save graph state snapshots after every iteration for debugging and visualization
- Deploy transformation agents in parallel when possible (multiple Task calls in single response)
- Include parent thought context in every transformation agent prompt
- Use descriptive node IDs (n1_root, n2_evidence_branch, n3_safety_concerns)
- Track token usage and enforce budget constraints
- Provide self-contained context to transformation agents (they can't access graph state directly)

**DON'T:**
- Assume transformation agents will coordinate (they work independently)
- Skip scoring step (every thought must be evaluated)
- Keep all nodes (pruning is essential for quality and efficiency)
- Deploy agents without clear exploration angles (causes redundant work)
- Forget to update frontier after adding new nodes

**Quality Standards:**
- Graph state is valid JSON and parseable at any iteration
- Every node has score, text, depth, parent references
- Frontier only contains leaf nodes at current depth
- Final report cites sources from best path only
- Token usage stays within budget (default 50,000 tokens)

## Domain Knowledge

### Graph of Thoughts Core Concepts

**Graph Structure:**
```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "n1": {
      "id": "n1",
      "text": "Root research question or initial finding",
      "score": 0.0,
      "depth": 0,
      "type": "root",
      "parents": [],
      "sources": []
    },
    "n2": {
      "id": "n2",
      "text": "Generated thought exploring angle 1",
      "score": 8.2,
      "depth": 1,
      "type": "generate",
      "parents": ["n1"],
      "sources": ["url1", "url2"]
    }
  },
  "edges": [
    {"from": "n1", "to": "n2", "operation": "Generate"}
  ],
  "frontier": ["n2", "n3", "n4"],
  "budget": {
    "tokens_used": 12500,
    "max_tokens": 50000
  },
  "iteration": 2
}
```

**Scoring Function (0-10 scale):**
- **9-10**: Exceptional - Multiple authoritative sources, novel insights, comprehensive coverage
- **7-8**: Strong - Good sources, clear findings, well-cited
- **5-6**: Adequate - Some sources, basic findings, gaps exist
- **3-4**: Weak - Poor sources, incomplete, major gaps
- **0-2**: Unusable - No sources, inaccurate, or incoherent

**Transformation Operations:**

1. **Generate(k)**: Create k diverse thoughts from parent
   - Input: Parent thought + k exploration angles
   - Output: k new child thoughts with scores
   - Use: Early exploration (depth 0-2) or deepening strong paths

2. **Aggregate(k)**: Merge k thoughts into stronger synthesis
   - Input: k parent thoughts (usually high-scoring)
   - Output: 1 unified thought combining best elements
   - Use: Late stage (depth 3+) with multiple quality branches

3. **Refine(1)**: Improve existing thought without new research
   - Input: 1 parent thought (usually medium-scoring)
   - Output: 1 enhanced thought (same core content, better quality)
   - Use: When thought has potential but execution is weak

**Pruning Strategy:**
- Keep top 5 nodes per depth level (KeepBestN(5))
- Prune immediately after scoring new nodes
- Preserve diversity: Keep best from different exploration angles
- Never prune nodes in best path to root

### Orchestration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Broad Exploration (Early Stage)**
```
Iteration 1:
- Root → Generate(3) exploring diverse angles
- Result: 3 branches at depth 1
- Keep all if scores vary, prune lowest if similar

Iteration 2:
- Top 2 branches → Generate(2) each
- Result: 4 branches at depth 2
- Prune to keep top 3
```

**Pattern 2: Depth-First Refinement (Mid Stage)**
```
Iteration 3:
- Best branch (8.5) → Generate(2) to deepen
- Medium branch (7.2) → Refine(1) to improve
- Result: 3 new nodes
- Prune to keep top 5 across all depths
```

**Pattern 3: Synthesis Convergence (Late Stage)**
```
Iteration 4:
- Identify 3 high-quality branches (8+)
- Aggregate(3) to merge insights
- Result: 1 comprehensive synthesis
- If score > 9.0, terminate; else refine
```

### Agent Network

**Transformation Agents (Deployed by Controller):**

- **research-generator**: Executes Generate(k) operations
  - Receives: Parent thought + exploration angle
  - Returns: New thought + score + sources

- **research-refiner**: Executes Refine(1) operations
  - Receives: Parent thought + improvement focus
  - Returns: Enhanced thought + updated score

- **research-aggregator**: Executes Aggregate(k) operations
  - Receives: k parent thoughts
  - Returns: Synthesized thought + score

**Coordination Protocol:**
- Controller maintains graph state (agents don't see full graph)
- Each agent receives only necessary parent context
- Agents return structured JSON for easy graph integration
- Controller handles all graph updates and pruning

### Context Management Strategy

**For Transformation Agents:**
- Provide parent thought text in full
- Include parent score as quality indicator
- Specify exploration angle or improvement focus
- Include topic context and user requirements
- DO NOT send entire graph state (too large, not needed)

**For Graph State Files:**
- Save complete graph after each iteration
- Use descriptive filenames: `graph_state_[N].json`
- Include iteration metadata (timestamp, token usage)
- Store in project research folder for traceability

**Token Budget Management:**
- Track cumulative tokens across all agent deployments
- Reserve 10,000 tokens for final synthesis
- Terminate early if approaching budget limit
- Prune more aggressively if tokens running high

### Termination Criteria

**Stop when ANY condition met:**
1. **Quality threshold**: Best node score > 9.0
2. **Depth limit**: Current depth > 4
3. **Budget exhausted**: tokens_used > max_tokens
4. **Convergence**: Last 2 iterations produce no score improvement
5. **User intervention**: User requests early termination

**Before Terminating:**
- Ensure at least one high-quality path exists (score > 7.0)
- If all paths weak, perform one final Refine pass
- Save final graph state with termination reason

├── graph_state_0.json
├── data/
├── visuals/
├── sources/
├── research_notes/
└── appendices/
```

### Iteration 1: Broad Exploration

**Transformation Decision:** Generate(3) from n1_root

**Deploy 3 Agents (parallel):**

Agent 1 - Current Evidence:
```
Task: research-generator
Prompt: You are Generate transformation creating branch 1 from:
"Research CRISPR gene editing safety: current evidence, ethical concerns, regulatory status"

Your exploration angle: CURRENT CLINICAL EVIDENCE
- Success rates in trials
- Off-target effects data
- Long-term safety studies
- Comparative safety vs other gene therapies

Execute:
1. WebSearch "CRISPR clinical trials safety data 2023-2024"
2. Score each source quality (1-10)
3. WebFetch top 3 authoritative sources
4. Synthesize findings (300-400 words) with inline citations
5. Self-score (0-10) based on: citation density, source quality, comprehensiveness

Return JSON:
{
  "node_id": "n2_clinical_evidence",
  "text": "synthesized findings...",
  "score": 8.2,
  "sources": ["url1", "url2", "url3"],
  "operation": "Generate",
  "parent": "n1_root",
  "depth": 1
}
```

Agent 2 - Ethical Concerns:
```
[Similar structure, angle: ETHICAL AND SAFETY CONCERNS]
```

Agent 3 - Regulatory Status:
```
[Similar structure, angle: REGULATORY LANDSCAPE]
```

**Results Received:**
- n2_clinical_evidence: Score 8.2 (strong evidence, good sources)
- n3_ethical_concerns: Score 7.5 (adequate, some gaps)
- n4_regulatory: Score 6.8 (weak, incomplete data)

**Graph Update:**
```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "n1_root": {...},
    "n2_clinical_evidence": {"score": 8.2, "depth": 1, ...},
    "n3_ethical_concerns": {"score": 7.5, "depth": 1, ...},
    "n4_regulatory": {"score": 6.8, "depth": 1, ...}
  },
  "edges": [
    {"from": "n1_root", "to": "n2_clinical_evidence", "operation": "Generate"},
    {"from": "n1_root", "to": "n3_ethical_concerns", "operation": "Generate"},
    {"from": "n1_root", "to": "n4_regulatory", "operation": "Generate"}
  ],
  "frontier": ["n2_clinical_evidence", "n3_ethical_concerns", "n4_regulatory"],
  "budget": {"tokens_used": 8500, "max_tokens": 50000},
  "iteration": 1
}
```

**Save State:** `graph_state_1.json`

**Termination Check:** max_score = 8.2 < 9.0, depth = 1 < 4 → CONTINUE

### Iteration 2: Deepen Best Paths

**Transformation Decisions:**
- n2_clinical_evidence (8.2): Generate(2) - deepen strong path
- n3_ethical_concerns (7.5): Generate(1) - moderate exploration
- n4_regulatory (6.8): Refine(1) - improve weak node

**Deploy 4 Agents:**

From n2 (clinical evidence):
- Agent: Dive into off-target effects research
- Agent: Investigate long-term safety data

From n3 (ethical concerns):
- Agent: Explore germline editing ethics specifically

For n4 (regulatory):
- Agent: Refine with better regulatory sources

**Results:**
- n5_off_targets: Score 9.1 (excellent - high-fidelity variants reduce off-targets 95%)
- n6_longterm: Score 7.8 (good longitudinal data)
- n7_germline_ethics: Score 8.0 (strong ethical framework)
- n8_regulatory_refined: Score 7.4 (improved but still gaps)

**Termination Check:** max_score = 9.1 > 9.0 → Consider termination OR one more iteration to aggregate

### Iteration 3: Final Synthesis

**Transformation Decision:** Aggregate(3) - merge best nodes (n5, n7, n6)

**Deploy Aggregator:**
```
Task: research-aggregator
Prompt: Combine these 3 high-quality thoughts into comprehensive synthesis:

[n5_off_targets text] Score: 9.1
[n7_germline_ethics text] Score: 8.0
[n6_longterm text] Score: 7.8

Merge into unified synthesis that:
- Preserves all key findings and citations
- Resolves any contradictions
- Achieves higher quality than any input
- Provides balanced safety assessment

Return synthesized thought with score.
```

**Result:**
- n9_final_synthesis: Score 9.5

**Termination Check:** max_score = 9.5 > 9.0 → TERMINATE

### Phase 3: Final Output

**Best Path Extraction:**
n1_root → n2_clinical_evidence → n5_off_targets → n9_final_synthesis

**Generate Report:**
```
